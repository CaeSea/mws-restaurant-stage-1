# What is this project?

This project is a restaurant reviews website. The project started as a non-responsive website with limited accessibility options and with no
service worker. During the project I added these details in to make the website fully ready for deployment on all devices.

# What did I do?

- Implemented a service worker so that the site is available offline.
- Accessibility options including ARIA, focus and semantics.
- Responsive design.

# How do I run the project?

The project is meant to be run using python http server. For computers with python already installed, simply run the command `python -m http.server 8000` and navigate to http://localhost:8000/
